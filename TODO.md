# TODO for Demonic Serpent Game Updates

- [x] Update script.js for snake visual upgrade (curved interpolation, tapering segments, glow aura, shimmer)
- [x] Update script.js for demonic entity visual upgrade (image sprites, flicker, particle bursts, hovering motion, boss animation)
- [x] Update script.js for border collision behavior (pause on wall, red flash, direction change to resume)
- [x] Update style.css for glow filters, mix-blend-mode: screen, soft shadows
- [x] Update assets with new images (snake_segment.png, demon_entity.png, boss_demon.png, orb.png) and sounds (hiss.mp3, growl.mp3, orb.wav, ambient.mp3)
- [x] Test updated game by launching index.html and verifying new features (critical path: visuals, mechanics, sounds noted as missing files)
